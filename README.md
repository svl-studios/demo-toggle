#SVL Demo Toggle

This plugin adds a toggle to the website to display an array of images representing different demo sites.

The array of demo blocks is set using shortcodes.  For simplicity, these can be set via the WPBakery Page Builder modules.  Or, if you're savvy, manually using the format shown below.


##Notes
* Demo site block images, ideally, should be 350x475 pixels.
